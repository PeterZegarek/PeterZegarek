### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Zegarek, and I am a Computer Science major at Quinnipiac University! I am graduating in May 2025, and enrolled in a 3+1 program, meaning that I'll be getting a Master's Degree in Cybersecurity in May 2026. Throughout my experience at Quinnipiac, I have been a part of various projects. Whether it's for class, a hackathon, research, or just independent projects, I have a lot of projects under my belt and am always taking on new projects so that I can learn more and make cool things! 

Some of my notable projects are pinned on my repo.

One of my favorite projects was my game for the SER225 class, titled Elemental Hero. In that project, myself and 3 other developers took on an already existing Java platformer game engine, and we added in various new features. Some of my favorite features that I added on were:
  - The possibility of ranged elemental attacks
  - The electric level as well as the final boss level
  - Some aspects of the final boss
  - Various enemies throughout the game
  - Various bosses throughout the game
  
I won't spoil much more of the game, so feel free to check it out! 

As for what I've been working on recently (and am looking to get into):
  - I have an independent research project working on AI over-the-phone speech translation
  - I am looking at getting into some game-dev (using Unity, most likely)
